Hypha is intended to facilitate collaboration in small (distributed)
project groups that want to share information within the group and
publish (part of) it on a project website. It was designed with the
following principles in mind:

 * **user friendly**: A project website should be simple to use for all
   group members. Hypha doesn't use wiki markup codes, but a familiar
   WYSIWYG editor. No myriad of options, bells and whistles, but simply
   the basic features.
 * **groupwork**: Any group member can edit any page. Hypha notifies
   group members of contributions to the project, and makes it very easy
   and intuitive to respond. Only a few advanced functions which have
   the power to mess up the whole system (like direct editing of low
   level page HTML/CSS) are shielded off by an admin level.
 * **revisions**: Hypha stores all versions of a page, shows differences
   between any two revisions and makes it easy to revert to an old
   version.
 * **multilingual**: Many groups work and communicate over borders and
   language barriers. Hypha makes it possible to manage any content in
   multiple translations by default.
 * **extensions**: Hypha contains a basic implementation for making
   plain webpages. It can however be extended with modules for other
   uses: mailinglist, forum etc.
 * **lightweight**: Hypha is written in php and javascript, and doesn't
   require a mySQL database. Content is stored in plain XML files. Total
   download size is kept under 100Kb.
 * **simple installation**: Uploading one fully self contained file is
   the goal.
 * **open source**: All code will be freely available
 * **no content license:** Your data is not owned by some big company
   but by you (or by your webhosting provider, depending on your
   contract with them)
 * **privacy:** Hypha doesn't log browsing behaviour. It shares
   information (contact info  of project members, system messages on
   updated pages etc) only within the group of registered project
   members.
 * **portable**: All links to internal pages and files are stored with
   relative paths.  Hypha can be copied to a different folder or system
   without breaking.
 * **safe email**: An email obfucation algorithm is used to prevent
   robots from scraping addresses for spammers.
