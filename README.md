Hypha is intended to facilitate collaboration in small (distributed) project groups that want to share information within the
group and publish (part of) it on a project website. It was designed with the following principles in mind:<ul>
<li>
<strong>user friendly</strong>: A project website should be simple to use for all group members. Hypha doesn't use wiki markup codes, but a familiar WYSIWYG editor. No myriad of options, bells and whistles, but simply the basic features.</li>
<li>
<strong>groupwork</strong>: Any group member can edit any page. Hypha notifies group members of contributions to the project, and makes it very easy and intuitive to respond. Only a few
advanced functions which have the power to mess up the whole system
(like direct editing of low level page HTML/CSS) are shielded off by an admin
level.
</li>
<li>
<strong>revisions</strong>: Hypha stores all versions of a page, shows
differences between any two revisions and makes it easy to revert to an
old version.</li>
<li>
<strong>multilingual</strong>: Many groups work and communicate over borders and language barriers. Hypha makes it possible to manage any content in multiple translations by default.</li>
<li>
<strong>extensions</strong>: Hypha contains a basic implementation for making plain webpages. It can however be extended with modules for other uses: mailinglist, forum etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>lightweight</strong>: Hypha is written in php and javascript, and doesn't require a mySQL database. Content is stored in plain XML files. Total download size is kept under 100Kb.</li>
<li>
<strong>simple installation</strong>: Uploading one fully self contained file is the goal.</li>
<li>
<strong>open source</strong>: All code will be freely available</li>
<li>
<strong>no content license:</strong> Your data is not owned by some big company but by you (or by your webhosting provider, depending on your contract with them)</li>
<li>
<strong>privacy: </strong>Hypha doesn't log browsing behaviour. It shares
information (contact info  of project members, system messages on updated pages etc) only within the group of registered project members.</li>
<li>
<strong>portable</strong>: All links to internal pages and files are stored with relative paths.  Hypha can be copied to a different folder or system without breaking.</li>
<li>
<strong>safe email</strong>: An email obfucation algorithm is used to prevent robots from scraping addresses for spammers.</li>
</ul>
